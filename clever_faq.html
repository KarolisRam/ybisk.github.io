<li><b>How clever or crazy should we get?</b><br>Go nuts! Need to draw a circle? Maybe you tape a sheet of paper around a basketball to create a cylinder and then trace the outside with a pencil? </li>
<br>
<li><b>This goal is very broad:</b><br>That's ok! As long as you think it's clear, it means you can come up with a pretty clever and crazy new way to acheive the same goal.</li>
<br>
<li><b>This particular solution needs to be very precise:</b><br>Are there any details that you can add or tweak? Often a solution indicates that you need to cut/heat/press/... something.  Is there an atypical way to do this?</li>
<br>
<li><b>Should we mark grammatical errors? </b><br>Unfortunately, some amount of grammatical errors seem to be unavoidable so for now if the goal/solution is understandable, you can ignore the grammar.</li>

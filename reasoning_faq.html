<li><b>How many sources should I use, do they need to be different for each fact?</b><br>
    No, there doesn't need to be a unique website for each but there should be a different passage for each</li>
<li><b>Do you have to match the prompt? Can we rewrite it?</b><br>
    Please rewrite it!  It's unlikely to be coherent or a full fledged question, and even if it is, you don't need to stick to it, but it hopefully helps you get started
    </li>
<li><b>There is no definitive answer to this question</b><br>
    If possible, formulating a question with a precise answer would be great, but if you can justify your answer with sources, that's fine too</li>
<li><b>The prompt is too narrow</b><br>
    Please feel free to broaden it.  Thanks!</li>
<li><b>By request, we have added a fourth fact box</b><br>
    You do <b>not</b> need to use all boxes</li>

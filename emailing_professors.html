      The following is a quick note about (cold) emailing professors.  You have undoubtedly seen that many professors have notes on their websites that simply say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt email me.‚Äù I‚Äôd like to encourage you to <b><i>selectively</i></b> ignore that advice but understand why, when and how.

          <tr><td width=400>Are you currently working with me?      </td><td>Email me</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Are you underrepresented in academia? </td><td>Email me</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Are you simply telling me you applied?  </td><td>Thanks, low probability of a reply</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Are you mass mailing every professor?   </td><td>Please no</td></tr>

              Success in academia, like many aspects of society, is often a function of who you know and networking.  Students of famous professors don‚Äôt need to email because they know their applications will get read carefully. Further, they may have had the opportunity to meet potential advisors at conferences and so they are already well connected when applying.  If you don‚Äôt fit this description, as many of us don‚Äôt,
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>How are you supposed to break into the ‚Äúin-group‚Äù? </li>
                <li>How is someone from a smaller lab, a different discipline, or an underrepresented group supposed to change the field?</li>
              </ul>

              They have to email.  They have to take the chance of getting no reply to at least put themselves out there.  If this is you, please email me and everyone else.

              Professors get lots of emails, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre reading this.  Many of them are generic and have nothing to do with their specific research.  Let‚Äôs say a professor works 40hrs a week and works with 10 students/collaborators.  
              <ul>
                <li>40 - 10hrs of collaboration meetings = 30hrs.</li>
                <li>3hrs teaching, 6hrs preparing, & one office hour = 20hrs left.</li>
                <li>Thesis committees, graduate admissions, hiring, rec letters, ‚Ä¶ = 10hrs.  </li>
                <li>Grant writing and staying current on the literature‚Ä¶ = 0hrs.  </li>
              </ul>

              All of these things actually take much longer than what I‚Äôve listed and are worse around paper and grant deadlines, but we still haven‚Äôt budgeted any time to reply to emails from our collaborators or anybody else.  This means, a professor likely is reading your email while eating lunch, on the bus on the way home, or at night when they are trying to figure out what they forgot to do today.  So, a useful exercise might be to ask yourself: 
              <ol>
                <li>How much time does it take to reply to the email I‚Äôm sending?</li>
                <li>Is this email actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DOS attack</a>?  [i.e. did it take me much less time to write than it will for them to reply?]</li>
              </ol>

              You don‚Äôt and that sucks, I‚Äôm sorry.  Normally you can assume they will try and take one or two per year but funding changes as do other commitments.  A professor deciding to have a child, work with a start-up, create a new conference, or any number of other things might eat into their time and so they may not take anybody that year.
